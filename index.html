            On this website I will talk about the pros and cons of getting pets as well as some different options for pets.
        </p>    
        <h2>What pets are there?</h2>
        <p>
            There are many different options for pets but for some people different pets are better to get then others. Here are some of the pets that I would recommend for
            people to get.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fish- these are for people new to pets as they will help you get into the habot of feeding a pet daily</li>
            <li>birds- these are more of an intermidiate pet, they are good to get and learn how to take care of a pet more then a fish but are not on the same level of 
            commitment as something like a cat or dog</li>
            <li>cats and dogs- these are pets that are difficult to care for but if you get into a routine they can be very rewarding to have</li>
            <li>reptiles- reptiles are fun pets to have and some people love to have them</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Keep in mind these are only my suggestions for pets and there are many more that you can get so if you are contimplating getting a pet, take a trip to your local pet
            store and browse arounf for a bit.
        </p>
       
        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <p>
            There are many pros and cons that need to be considered when getting a pet. Here are some that I have thought about in the past when getting pets.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>there have been many studies that show pets can help raise your levels of happiness</li>
            <li>pets are great companions that can help you not feel lonly</li>
            <li>pets like dogs are great for helping to get you more active</li>
            <li>pets have also been shown to redice level of stress</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>pets can be expensive to get and keep healthy</li>
            <li>pets may be difficult to clean up after</li>
            <li>some pets can be very time consuming</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>With all of these it may be hard to decide of you do want to get a pet and in my opinion you should they are great companions and are a joy to be around</p>
