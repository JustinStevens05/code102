        On this website I will talk about the pros and cons of getting pets as well as some different options for pets.
    </p>    
    <h2>What pets are there?</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different options for pets but for some people different pets are better to get then others. Here are some of the pets that I would recommend for
        people to get.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fish- these are for people new to pets as they will help you get into the habot of feeding a pet daily</li>
        <li>birds- these are more of an intermidiate pet, they are good to get and learn how to take care of a pet more then a fish but are not on the same level of 
        commitment as something like a cat or dog</li>
        <li>cats and dogs- these are pets that are difficult to care for but if you get into a routine they can be very rewarding to have</li>
        <li>reptiles- reptiles are fun pets to have and some people love to have them</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Keep in mind these are only my suggestions for pets and there are many more that you can get so if you are contimplating getting a pet, take a trip to your local pet
        store and browse arounf for a bit.
